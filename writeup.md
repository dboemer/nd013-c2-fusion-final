# Final Project: Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking

This is the final project of the section "Sensor Fusion and Tracking" in [Udacity's Nanodegree Program "Self Driving Car Engineer"](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013).


## 1. Tracking

The functions related to tracking have been implemented in [filter.py](student/filter.py).  The resulting RMSE is shown below.  Despite a relatively high initial error, it is gradually reduced to reach a mean below 0.35 m.
